### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Fresh Graduate with a Bachelor of Informatics Degree (Computer Science), with 2 years of experience in Frontend Web Development using Javascript programming language. I'm used to developing some web applications using the ReactJs and NextJs framework, as well as TailwindCSS for styling and managing the layout. Recently, I also managed a Fullstack Web Application project. I have strong understanding of modern web development technology and always follow the best practices guidelines as a developer, also accustomed to working either individually or as part of a team.
